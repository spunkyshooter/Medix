NOTES:

A 71-year-old female in Pennsylvania was accidentally taking an antipsychotic for three months,
instead of her anti-hypertensive medication. This led to ambulatory dysfunction, mood swings,
tremors and many other physiological changes because of the medication error in manual
prescription.

It’s high time for doctors to discontinue with the option of writing medical prescriptions
manually. With e-prescribing, doctors can significantly prevent drug prescription errors and
instantly reconcile a patient’s medication history. The medication reconciliation process
becomes easier, as there is no need to flip through cumbersome prescription papers stored in a
physical folder.

Electronic prescriptions also eliminate chances of wrong drugs being dispensed due to
handwriting errors. This not only helps doctors but even patients who can have trust over their
doctor that right drugs have been selected from extensive formulary stored in hospital
information systems like Med-E-Nova.


Maintaining medical records manually leads to duplication of efforts and loss of productivity.

"Making sure that clinical notes are up to date and completed accurately with sufficient
information will ensure that the proper information is provided to all relevant healthcare
workers and will aid them in potential future decisions. This, in turn, will benefit the
patient through less time lost on repeating tests and by averting inaccurate diagnoses
or the prescription of inappropriate treatments."
